Artemis Financial is undertaking a comprehensive initiative to update, secure, and modernize its operations. The company aims to protect against external threats while developing a web-based software application. This involves a range of measures, including dependency checking, certification generation, input validation, and the selection and implementation of secure algorithms for data encryption. The software stack is primarily Java primarily the Spring framework, which required the team to become well-acquainted with its objects and frameworks. The legacy design left by previous engineers did not account for future scalability and security, necessitating a thorough overhaul of the existing architecture.

To ensure robust security, the team conducted extensive testing before, during, and after implementation. Registering for an NVD (National Vulnerability Database) key has been particularly beneficial, as it speeds up the dependency check process, allowing for quicker identification and mitigation of vulnerabilities. This strategic approach not only secures the application but also exemplifies the depth and breadth of knowledge in secure computing, a valuable asset for any future employers. The integration of these security measures demonstrates a commitment to delivering a reliable and resilient software solution.
